This was created as a learning excercise while learning how to use CakePHP through [Blog tutorial Part one](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/tutorials-and-examples/blog/blog.html) and [Blog tutorial Part two](https://book.cakephp.org/3.0/en/tutorials-and-examples/blog/part-two.html).

[Oven](https://github.com/CakeDC/oven) was helpful for installing a barebones CakePHP setup.
